                    <p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.
                    The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home
                    planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has
                    guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

                    <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants. The biological
                    function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.

                    <p>An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding, or any in-depth analysis of
                    a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose.

                    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to
                    incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and
                    infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
